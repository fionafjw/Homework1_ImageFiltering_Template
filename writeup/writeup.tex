\section*{Declaration of Generative AI Use}

\subsection*{Reminder of Course Policy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, Bard) for completing any part of this course is discouraged.
    \item Using these tools is not needed to be successful in the class and could be detrimental to your learning experience.
    \item If you use them, you must cite the tool you used and explain how you used it.
    \item If you do not cite the tool, it is an academic code violation.
    \item We will be using special tools to detect cases of unattributed GenAI use.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Assignment Overview}

The assignment contains two functions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item my\_imfilter \\
    It takes in an image and a kernel and convolves the two inputs to make a filtered image
    \item gen\_hybrid\_images \\
    It takes in two images and a cutoff frequency. The function takes low frequencies from the first image with a Gaussian blur (where the standard deviation is based off the cutoff frequency), high frequencies from the second image, and combines the filtered images to create a hybrid image.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Implementation Detail}

In my first approach in writing the function my\_imfilter, I modeled the mathematical equation for 2D convolution,
\begin{center}
$h[m, n] = \sum_{k,l} f[k,l]I[m-k, n-l]$
\end{center}
in code. For gray scale images I used 2 loops to visit every element of the image. At each element, I used logical indexing to extract a matrix of the kernel's shape which is highlighted in this code snippet.
\begin{python}
neighborhood = image[x-pad_h:x+pad_h+1, y-pad_w: y+pad_w+1, c]
\end{python}
The used numpy functions multiply and sum to perform element wise multiplication on the kernel and neighborhood and summing all the elements together. Then I stored the sum into the corresponding coordinate of the output image.\\
For RGB images, the code performs the same process except three times on each channel, so, I implemented a third for loop. \\\\
\textbf{Final Improved Approach to Speed Up}: I realized that this approach was slow and wrote a new function to take advantage of numpy array operations. Instead of updating one pixel at a time, the optimized function performs multiplication by each kernel element, as the kernel size is much smaller than the image size. Then the function shifts each multiplied image by the distance from the kernel center and adds each shifted matrix together.
\\\\
gen\_hybrid\_image first takes low frequencies from image1 with a Gaussian blur and then takes high frequencies from image2 by taking a Gaussian blur on image2 and then subtracting the filtered image2 from the original image2. Then it adds the low frequency image1 and high frequency image2 and clips out of range values to produce the hybrid image.

\section*{Result}
On the next page are my three hybrid images:
